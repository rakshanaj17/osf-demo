    <h1>Supervision by Nonphysician Practitioners of Hospital and CAH Diagnostic Services Furnished to Outpatients</h1>
    <div style="color: grey;">
        The regulation at 42 CFR 410.32 provides the conditions of Medicare Part B payment for diagnostic tests. Section
        410.32(b) provides the supervision requirements for diagnostic x-ray tests, diagnostic laboratory tests, and
        other diagnostic tests paid under the PFS. Prior to 2020, the regulation allowed only physicians as defined
        under Medicare law to supervise the performance of these diagnostic tests.
        In the interim final rule with comment period published on May 8, 2020, in the
        Federal Register
        titled “Additional Policy and Regulatory Revisions in Response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency and Delay
        of Certain Reporting Requirements for the Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting Program” (the May 8th
        COVID-19 IFC) (85 FR 27550, 27555 through 27556, 27620), we revised
    </div>
    <div style="color: darkgreen;">
        §  410.32(b)(1) to allow, for the duration of the PHE, certain nonphysician practitioners (nurse practitioners,
        physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists and certified nurse midwifes) to supervise the performance of
        diagnostic tests to the extent they were authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State
        law.
        In the CY 2021 PFS final rule (85 FR 84590 through 84492, 85026), we further revised §  410.32(b)(1) to make the
        revisions made by the May 8th COVID-19 IFC permanent and to add certified registered nurse anesthetists to the
        list of nonphysician practitioners permitted to provide supervision of diagnostic tests to the extent authorized
        to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law.As we explained in those final rules, the basis
        for making these revisions was to both ensure that an adequate number of health care professionals were
        available to support critical COVID-19-related and other diagnostic testing needs and provide needed medical
        care during the PHE and to implement policy consistent with section 5(a) of the President's Executive Order
        13890 on “Protecting and Improving Medicare for Our Nation's Seniors” (84 FR 53573, October 8, 2019, E.O.
        13890), which directed the Secretary to identify and modify Medicare regulations that contained more restrictive
        supervision requirements than existing scope of practice laws, or that limited healthcare professionals from
        practicing at the top of their license. We refer readers to the May 8th COVID-19 IFC (85 FR 27555 through 27556,
        27620) and CY 2021 PFS final rule (85 FR 84590 through 84492, 85026) for a more detailed discussion of the
        reasoning behind our revisions to §  410.32.
        Section 410.32(b)(1), titled “Basic rule,” provides that all diagnostic x-ray and other diagnostic tests covered
        under section 1861(s)(3) of the Act and payable under the physician fee schedule must be furnished under the
        Start Printed Page 72024
        appropriate level of supervision by a physician as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act or, to the extent that
        they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law, by a nurse practitioner,
        clinical nurse specialist, physician assistant, certified registered nurse anesthetist, or a certified
        nurse-midwife. Section 410.32(b)(2) provides a list of services that are excepted from the basic rule in § 
        410.32(b)(1). Section 410.32(b)(3) defines the levels of supervision referenced in §  410.32(b)(1): general
        supervision (§  410.32(b)(3)(i)); direct supervision (§  410.32(b)(3)(ii)); and personal supervision (§ 
        410.32(b)(3)(iii)). Within these three definitions, only the definition for direct supervision indicates that a
        “supervising practitioner” other than a physician can provide the required supervision. The definitions for
        general and personal supervision continue to refer only to a physician providing the required level of
        supervision. Although the definitions of general and personal supervision do not specify that a “supervising
        practitioner” could furnish these levels of supervision, the above-described revisions to the “basic rule”
        governing supervision of diagnostic tests at §  410.32(b)(1) allow certain nonphysician practitioners to provide
        general and personal supervision to the extent they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and
        applicable State law.
        Section 410.28 provides conditions of payment for diagnostic services under Medicare Part B provided to
        outpatients by, or under arrangements by, hospitals and CAHs, including specific supervision requirements under
        §  410.28(e) for diagnostic tests in those settings. Section 410.28(e) relies upon the definitions of general,
        direct (for nonhospital locations) and personal supervision at §  410.32(b)(3)(i) through (iii) by
        cross-referencing those definitions. As noted above, the term “supervising practitioner” is absent from those
        definitions, although the “basic rule” at §  410.32(b)(1) allows certain nonphysician practitioners to provide
        general and personal supervision to the extent they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and
        applicable State law. However, §  410.32(b) is explicitly limited to “all diagnostic x-ray and other diagnostic
        tests covered under section 1861(s)(3) of the Act and payable under the physician fee schedule,” and § 
        410.28(e) does not contain any such “basic rule” to clarify that nonphysician practitioners can provide general
        and personal supervision.For purposes of clarity and consistency, we proposed to revise §  410.28(e) to clarify
        that the same nonphysician practitioners that can provide general and personal supervision of diagnostic testing
        services payable under the PFS under §  410.32(b) can provide supervision of diagnostic testing services
        furnished to outpatients by hospitals or CAHs. Specifically, we proposed to revise our existing supervision
        requirements at §  410.28(e) to clarify that nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, physician
        assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives may provide general, direct,
        and personal supervision of outpatient diagnostic services to the extent that they are authorized to do so under
        their scope of practice and applicable State law.Another revision that we proposed to §  410.28(e) was to extend
        the end date of the flexibility allowing for the virtual supervision of outpatient diagnostic services through
        audio/video real-time communications technology (excluding audio-only) from the end of the PHE to the end of the
        calendar year in which the PHE ends. The purpose of this proposal was to ensure consistency between the hospital
        and CAH regulations at §§ 410.27 and 410.28 with the physicians' office regulations at § 410.32. Although the
        proposed rule contained the proposed revisions to the regulatory text of §  410.28(e), regrettably, the above
        explanation of the reason for the proposed revisions was inadvertently omitted from the preamble of the proposed
        rule.We also proposed to replace the cross-references at §  410.28(e) to the definitions of general, direct (for
        outpatient services provided at a nonhospital location), and personal supervision at §  410.32(b)(3)(i) through
        (iii) with the text of those definitions as newly designated paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii), and
        (e)(3) so that they are now contained within §  410.28.Similarly, since §  410.27, which provides the
        supervision requirements for therapeutic outpatient hospital and CAH services, also relies on the definitions of
        general and personal supervision at §  410.32(b)(3)(i) and (iii), we proposed to replace the cross-references at
        §  410.27(a)(1)(iv)(A) and (B) with the text of those definitions so that they are now contained within § 
        410.27. Additionally, for clarity we proposed to designate the existing definition of direct supervision and the
        proposed definition of personal supervision at §  410.27(a)(1)(iv)(B) as §  410.27(a)(1)(iv)(B)(1) and (2),
        respectively. Finally, since §  410.27(a)(1)(iv)(B) and (D) contain duplicate definitions for direct
        supervision, we proposed to remove §  410.27(a)(1)(iv)(D) in its entirety and add its language regarding
        pulmonary rehabilitation, cardiac rehabilitation, and intensive cardiac rehabilitation services and the virtual
        presence of a physician through audio/video real-time communications technology during the PHE to the newly
        designated §  410.27(a)(1)(iv)(B)(1).We received the following comments in response to our proposal:
        Comment:
        The majority of commenters supported our proposal, citing clarity, consistency, increased patient access to care
        and allowing nonphysician practitioners to practice at the top of their licenses and clinical training.

        Response:
        We thank commenters for their support for our proposal.

        Comment:
        Two commenters supported the proposal but objected to the continued use of the term “nonphysician practitioner.”
        One commenter suggested that we replace “nonphysician practitioner” with each practitioner's professional title
        (
        i.e.,
        “nurse practitioner,” “physician assistant,” etc.) or, collectively, “advance practice providers” and update all
        related regulations, guidance and information collection instruments accordingly. The second commenter similarly
        suggested that we expressly list “physician assistant,” “nurse practitioner,” and other professionals in the
        place of “nonphysician practitioner” and accordingly revise all related guidance documents.

        Response:
        We appreciate these comments and agree with the importance of employing the appropriate designations for these
        practitioners. We note that §§ 410.27(g) and 410.28(e) specifically list the professional titles that are
        included in the term “nonphysician practitioner” for the purpose of each regulation. It is therefore unnecessary
        and would be impractical to replace all instances of “nonphysician practitioner” throughout each regulation with
        a list of each practitioner's professional titles. With respect to replacing “nonphysician practitioner” with
        “advance practice providers,” we understand the importance of using the most relevant and up to date terminology
        to describe these practitioners. However, as acknowledged by the commenters, “nonphysician practitioner” is used
        in
        Start Printed Page 72025
        multiple regulations, guidance and other documents and any change in terminology would need to be considered in
        light of ensuring consistency across these authorities. We will take this suggestion into consideration for
        future rulemaking.

        Comment:
        One commenter supported the proposal and requested, for improved clarity and to eliminate inefficiencies or
        delays in care caused by a misinterpretation of supervision policy, that we revise the definitions for general
        and personal supervision at § 410.32(b)(2)(i) and (iii) to include the “or other supervising practitioner”
        language contained in the definition for direct supervision at § 410.32(b)(2)(iii). Another commenter suggested
        that we revise the definitions for general and personal supervision at § 410.32(b)(2)(i) and (iii) to
        specifically reference “physician assistant.”

        Response:
        We appreciate the commenters' suggestions but disagree that adding “or other supervising practitioner” or
        individual professional titles to the definitions for general and personal supervision at § 410.32(b)(2)(i) and
        (iii) would improve clarity or eliminate inefficiencies or delays in care caused by a misinterpretation of
        supervision policy. As acknowledged by the commenter, the “basic rule” governing supervision of diagnostic tests

        their scope of practice and applicable State law, by a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, physician
        assistant, certified registered nurse anesthetist, or a certified nurse-midwife.” Section 410.32(b)(2) provides
        a list of services that a <div style="color: darkgreen;"> (i) and (iii) and doing so would likely result in further misinterpretations of
        supervision policy. 

        Comment:
        Two commenters opposed the proposed change, arguing that nonphysician practitioner skill sets are not
        interchangeable with those of fully educated and trained physicians and that physicians' more excepted from the
        tensive and rigorous educational and training requirements make them uniquely qualified to supervise diagnostic
        tests. The first commenter maintains that physicians must supervise diagnostic tests to ensure patient safety
        and the accuracy of test results due to the complexity of certain diagnostic tests and studies demonstrating
        that nonphysician practitioners order more diagnostic tests, including tests subasic rule in § 410jecting
        patients to harmful radiation, than physicians.32( This commenter also refers to a study that concluded that
        allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to function with independent patient panels under
        physician supervision in the primary care setting resulted in higher costs, higher utilization of services and
        lower quality of care as compared to panels of patients with a primary care physician. The second commenter
        references surveys indicating that patients prefer physicians to lead their health care team and that more
        patients trust a physician to deliver their medical care in an emergency as compared to a nurse, nurse
        practitioner or physician assistant. Finally, b)(1)oth commenters argue that expanding the scope of practice of
        nurse practitioners will not increase patient access to care because the actual practice locations of nurse
        practitioners reveal that they tend to work in the same large urban areas as physicians. Section 410

        Response:
        We acknowledge that physician skill sets are not fully interchangeable with the skill sets of nonphysician
        practitioners and that the education and training requirements of physicians differ from nonphysician
        practitioners.32( However, we do not agree that the skill sets, education and training of physicians render them
        solely qualified to supervise diagnostic services. With respect to the commenter's concerns ab) </div>(3) defines the
        levels of supervision referenced in § 410.32(out nonphysician practitioners' ab)(1): general supervision
        (§ 410.32(b)(3)(i)); direct supervision (§ 410.32(b)(3)(ii)); and personal supervision (§ 410.32(b)(3)(iii)).
        Within these three definitionilities to safely and accurately perform diagnostic tests, only the definition for
        direct supervision indicates that a “supervising practitioner” other than a physician can provide the required
        supervision. The definitions for general and personal supervision continue to refer only to a physician
        providing the required level of supervision. Although the definitions of general and personal supervision do not
        specify that a “supervising practitioner” could furnish these levels of supervision, the above-described
        revisions to the “basic rule” governing supervision of diagnostic tests at § 410.32(b)(1) allow certain
        nonphysician practitioners to provide general and personal supervision to thee note that the proposed regulation
        extent they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable Splicitly limits nonphysician
        supervision to that which is permitted under the nonphysician practitioner's scope of practice and state
        law.Section 410 Furthermore, nothing in the proposed regulation prohibits or limits physicians from continuing

        respectively. Finally, since § 410.27(a)(1)(iv)(B) and (D) contain duplicate definitions for direct supervision,
        we propose to remove § 410.27(a)(1)(iv)(D) in its entirety and add its language regarding pulmonary
        rehabilitation, cardiac rehabilitation, and intensive cardiac rehabilitation services and the virtual presence
        of a physician through audio/video real-time communications technology during the PHE to the newly designated
