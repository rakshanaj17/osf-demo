    <h1>ACTION</h1>
    <p>Proposed rule.</p>
    <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
    <p>This proposed rule would revise the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) and the
        Medicare ambulatory surgical center (ASC) payment system for Calendar Year (CY) 2023 based on our continuing
        experience with these systems. In this proposed rule, we describe the changes to the amounts and factors used to
        determine the payment rates for Medicare services paid under the OPPS and those paid under the ASC payment
        system. Also, this proposed rule would update and refine the requirements for the Hospital Outpatient Quality
        Reporting (OQR) Program, the ASC Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program, and the Rural Emergency Hospital Quality
        Reporting (REH) Program. We are also proposing updates to the requirements for Organ Acquisition, Rural
        Emergency Hospitals, Prior Authorization, and Overall Hospital Quality Star Rating. We are establishing a new
        provider type for rural emergency hospitals (REHs), and we have proposals regarding payment policy, quality
        measures, and enrollment policy for REHs. Finally, we are soliciting comments on the use of CMS data to drive
        competition in healthcare marketplaces, and an alternative methodology for counting organs.</p>

    <h3>A. Executive Summary of This Document</h3>

    <h4>1. Purpose</h4>

    <p>
        In this proposed rule, we propose to update the payment policies and payment rates for services furnished to
        Medicare beneficiaries in hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) and ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs),
        beginning January 1, 2023. Section 1833(t) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires us to annually review
        and update the payment rates for services payable under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System
        (OPPS). Specifically, section 1833(t)(9)(A) of the Act requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and
        Human Services (the Secretary) to review certain components of the OPPS not less often than annually, and to
        revise the groups, the relative payment weights, and the wage and other adjustments that take into account
        changes in medical practice, changes in technology, and the addition of new services, new cost data, and other
        relevant information and factors. In addition, under section 1833(i)(D)(v) of the Act, we annually review and
        update the ASC payment rates. This proposed rule also includes additional policy changes made in accordance with
        our experience with the OPPS and the ASC payment system and recent changes in our statutory authority. We
        describe these and various other statutory authorities in the relevant sections of this proposed rule. In
        addition, this proposed rule would update and refine the requirements for the Hospital Outpatient Quality Start
        Printed Page 44505 Reporting (OQR) Program and the ASC Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program. We are also proposing
        updates to the requirements for Organ Acquisition, Prior Authorization, and Overall Hospital Quality Star
        Rating. We are also proposing new regulatory requirements to codify payment policy, quality measures, and
        enrollment policy for Rural Emergency Hospitals. Finally, we are soliciting comments on the use of CMS data to
        drive competition in healthcare marketplaces, and a Request for Information on an alternative methodology for
        counting organs.

    <h4>
        2. Summary of the Major Provisions
    </h4>

    <p>
        • OPPS Update: For 2023, we propose to increase the payment rates under the OPPS by an Outpatient Department
        (OPD) fee schedule increase factor of 2.7 percent. This proposed increase factor is based on the proposed
        hospital inpatient market basket percentage increase of 3.1 percent for inpatient services paid under the
        hospital inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) reduced by a proposed productivity adjustment of 0.4
        percentage point. Based on this update, we estimate that total payments to OPPS providers (including beneficiary
        cost-sharing and estimated changes in enrollment, utilization, and case-mix) for calendar year (CY) 2023 would
        be approximately $86.2 billion, an increase of approximately $6.2 billion compared to estimated CY 2022 OPPS
        payments.
    </p>

    <p>
        We propose to continue to implement the statutory 2.0 percentage point reduction in payments for hospitals that
        fail to meet the hospital outpatient quality reporting requirements by applying a reporting factor of 0.9805 to
        the OPPS payments and copayments for all applicable services.
    </p>

    <p>
        • Data used in CY 2023 OPPS/ASC Ratesetting: To set CY 2023 OPPS and ASC payment rates, we would normally use
        the most updated claims and cost report data available. The best available claims data is the most recent set of
        data which would be from 2 years prior to the calendar year that is the subject of rulemaking. Therefore, we are
        proposing to use the CY 2021 claims data to set CY 2023 OPPS and ASC rates. However, cost report data usually
        lags the claims data by a year and CMS believes that the CY 2020 cost report data are not the best overall
        approximation of expected outpatient hospital services as the majority of the cost reports we would typically
        use for CY 2023 rate setting have cost reporting periods that overlap with parts of the CY 2020 Public Health
        Emergency (PHE). In order to mitigate the impact of some of the temporary changes in hospitals cost report data
        from CY 2020, we propose to use cost report data from the June 2020 extract from Healthcare Cost Report
        Information System (HCRIS), which includes cost report data from prior to the PHE. This is the same cost report
        extract we used to set OPPS rates for CY 2022. We believe using the CY 2021 claims data with cost reports data
        through CY 2019 (prior to the PHE) for CY 2023 OPPS ratesetting is the best approximation of expected costs for
        CY 2023 hospital outpatient services for ratesetting purposes. As a result, CMS is proposing to use CY 2021
        claims data with cost reports with cost reporting periods prior to the PHE to set CY 2023 OPPS and ASC payment
        system rates.
