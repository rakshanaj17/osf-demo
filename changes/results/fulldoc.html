<tr><td class="red">This proposed rule would revise the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) and the Medicare ambulatory surgical center (ASC) payment system for Calendar Year (CY) 2023 based on our continuing experience with these systems. In this proposed rule, we describe the changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare services paid under the OPPS and those paid under the ASC payment system. Also, this proposed rule would update and refine the requirements for the Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program, the ASC Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program, and the Rural Emergency Hospital Quality Reporting (REH) Program. We are also proposing updates to the requirements for Organ Acquisition, Rural Emergency Hospitals, Prior Authorization, and Overall Hospital Quality Star Rating. We are establishing a new provider type for rural emergency hospitals (REHs), and we have proposals regarding payment policy, quality measures, and enrollment policy for REHs. Finally, we are soliciting comments on the use of CMS data to drive competition in healthcare marketplaces, and an alternative methodology for counting organs.</td><td></td></tr>

In addition, we are finalizing the Conditions of Participation that REHs must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This rule also finalizes changes to the Critical Access Hospitals (CAH) CoPs for the location and distance requirements, patient's rights requirements, and flexibilities for CAHs that are part of a larger health system. Finally, we are finalizing as implemented a number of provisions included in the COVID-19 interim final rules with comment period (IFCs).</td></tr>

To improve hospital preparedness and readiness for future threats, we are finalizing our proposal to provide payment adjustments to hospitals under the IPPS and OPPS for the additional resource costs they incur to acquire domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators. These surgical respirators, which faced severe shortage at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, are essential for the protection of beneficiaries and hospital personnel that interface with patients. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recognizes that procurement of domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators, while critical to pandemic preparedness and protecting health care workers and patients, can result in additional resource costs for hospitals. The payment adjustments will account for these additional resource costs.</td></tr>

Based on this update, we estimate that total payments to OPPS providers (including beneficiary cost-sharing and estimated changes in enrollment, utilization, and case-mix) for calendar year (CY) 2023 would be approximately $86.2 billion, an increase of approximately $6.2 billion compared to estimated CY 2022 OPPS payments.</td><td></td></tr>

For new technology services that are not eligible for transitional pass-through payments, and for which we lack sufficient clinical information and cost data to appropriately assign them to a clinical APC group, we have established special APC groups based on costs, which we refer to as New Technology APCs. These New Technology APCs are designated by cost bands which allow us to provide appropriate and consistent payment for designated new procedures that are not yet reflected in our claims data. Similar to pass-through payments, an assignment to a New Technology APC is temporary; that is, we retain a service within a New Technology APC until we acquire sufficient data to assign it to a clinically appropriate APC group.</td></tr>

It also excludes screening mammography, diagnostic mammography, and effective January 1, 2011, an annual wellness visit providing personalized prevention plan services. The Secretary exercises the authority granted under the statute to also exclude from the OPPS certain services that are paid under fee schedules or other payment systems. Such excluded services include, for example, the professional services of physicians and nonphysician practitioners paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS); certain laboratory services paid under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS); services for beneficiaries with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that are paid under the ESRD prospective payment system; and services and procedures that require an inpatient stay that are paid under the hospital IPPS.

<tr><td class="red">                         To set CY 2023 OPPS and ASC payment rates, we would normally use the most updated claims and cost report data available. The best available claims data is the most recent set of data which would be from 2 years prior to the calendar year that is the subject of rulemaking. Therefore, we are proposing to use the CY 2021 claims data to set CY 2023 OPPS and ASC rates. However, cost report data usually lags the claims data by a year and CMS believes that the CY 2020 cost report data are not the best overall approximation of expected outpatient hospital services as the majority of the cost reports we would typically use for CY 2023 rate setting have cost reporting periods that overlap with parts of the CY 2020 Public Health Emergency (PHE). In order to mitigate the impact of some of the temporary changes in hospitals cost report data from CY 2020, we propose to use cost report data from the June 2020 extract from Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS), which includes cost report data from prior to the PHE. This is the same cost report extract we used to set OPPS rates for CY 2022. We believe using the CY 2021 claims data with cost reports data through CY 2019 (prior to the PHE) for CY 2023 OPPS ratesetting is the best approximation of expected costs for CY 2023 hospital outpatient services for ratesetting purposes. As a result, CMS is proposing to use CY 2021 claims data with cost reports with cost reporting periods prior to the PHE to set CY 2023 OPPS and ASC payment system rates.</td><td></td></tr>

However, roughly half of the cost reports we would typically use for CY 2023 ratesetting purposes are from cost reporting periods that overlap with parts of CY 2020. When utilizing this cost report data, more than half of the APC geometric mean costs increased by more than 10 percent relative to estimates based on prior ratesetting cycles. While some of this increase may be attributable to changes that will continue into CY 2023, other aspects of those changes may be more specific to the COVID-19 PHE. In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (86 FR 63751 through 63754), we described how CY 2020 claims data were too influenced by the COVID-19 PHE to be utilized for setting CY 2022 OPPS payment rates.

<tr><td class="red">                         As discussed in section X.H of the preamble of this proposed rule, the Biden-Harris Administration has made it a priority to ensure America is prepared to continue to respond to COVID-19, and to combat future pandemics. To improve hospital preparedness and readiness for future threats, we are proposing to provide payment adjustments to hospitals under the IPPS and OPPS for the additional resource costs they incur to acquire domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators. These surgical respirators, which faced severe shortage at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, are essential for the protection of beneficiaries and hospital personnel that interface with patients. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recognizes that procurement of domestic NIOSH-approved surgical N95 respirators, while critical to pandemic preparedness and protecting health care workers and patients, can result in additional resource costs for hospitals.

For the proposed CY 2023 OPPS payment rates, we proposed to use CY 2021 claims processed through December 31, 2021. We applied the hospital-specific CCR to the hospital's charges at the most detailed level possible, based on a revenue code-to-cost center crosswalk that contains a hierarchy of CCRs used to estimate costs from charges for each revenue code. To ensure the completeness of the revenue code-to-cost center crosswalk, we reviewed changes to the list of revenue codes for CY 2021 (the year of claims data we used to calculate the proposed CY 2023 OPPS payment rates) and updates to the National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC) 2020 Data Specifications Manual.

Additionally, we are concerned about the significant changes in APC geometric mean costs that our analysis indicates would occur if we were to include such lines. We believe it is important to further investigate the accuracy of these cost report data before including such data in the ratesetting process. Further, we believe it is appropriate to gather additional information from the public as well before including them in OPPS ratesetting. For CY 2023, we proposed not to include the nonstandard cost centers reported in this way in the OPPS ratesetting database construction. We solicited comment on whether there exist any specific concerns with regards to the accuracy of the data from these nonstandard cost center lines that we would need to consider before including them in future OPPS ratesetting.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td class="green">We proposed in the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC proposed rule to continue to establish payment rates for blood and blood products using our blood-specific CCR methodology, which utilizes actual or simulated CCRs from the most recently available hospital cost reports to convert hospital charges for blood and blood products to costs. This methodology has been our standard ratesetting methodology for blood and blood products since CY 2005. It was developed in response to data analysis indicating that there was a significant difference in CCRs for those hospitals with and without blood-specific cost centers, and past public comments indicating that the former OPPS policy of defaulting to the overall hospital CCR for hospitals not reporting a blood-specific cost center often resulted in an underestimation of the true hospital costs for blood and blood products. Specifically, to address the differences in CCRs and to better reflect hospitals' costs, we proposed to continue to simulate blood CCRs for each hospital that does not report a blood cost center by calculating the ratio of the blood-specific CCRs to hospitals' overall CCRs for those hospitals that do report costs and charges for blood cost centers. We also proposed to apply this mean ratio to the overall CCRs of hospitals not reporting costs and charges for blood cost centers on their cost reports to simulate blood-specific CCRs for those hospitals. We proposed to calculate the costs upon which the proposed CY 2023 payment rates for blood and blood products are based using the actual blood-specific CCR for hospitals that reported costs and charges for a blood cost center and a hospital-specific, simulated, blood-specific CCR for hospitals that did not report costs and charges for a blood cost center.</td></tr>

Because nonexcepted items and services are not paid under the OPPS, in the CY 2019 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (83 FR 58832), we finalized a policy to remove those claim lines reported with modifier “PN” from the claims data used in ratesetting for the CY 2019 OPPS and subsequent years.

Line item charges for services included on the C-APC claim are converted to line item costs, which are then summed to develop the estimated APC costs. These claims are then assigned one unit of the service with status indicator “J1” and later used to develop the geometric mean costs for the C-APC relative payment weights. (We note that we use the term “comprehensive” to describe the geometric mean cost of a claim reporting “J1” service(s) or the geometric mean cost of a C-APC, inclusive of all of the items and services included in the C-APC service payment bundle.) Charges for services that would otherwise be separately payable are added to the charges for the primary service. This process differs from our traditional cost accounting methodology only in that all such services on the claim are packaged (except certain services as described above). We apply our standard data trims, which exclude claims with extremely high primary units or extreme costs.</td></tr>

For CY 2008, we developed composite APCs to provide a single payment for groups of services that are typically performed together during a single clinical encounter and that result in the provision of a complete service. Combining payment for multiple, independent services into a single OPPS payment in this way enables hospitals to manage their resources with maximum flexibility by monitoring and adjusting the volume and efficiency of services themselves. An additional advantage to the composite APC model is that we can use data from correctly coded multiple procedure claims to calculate payment rates for the specified combinations of services, rather than relying upon single procedure claims which may be low in volume and/or incorrectly coded. Under the OPPS, we currently have composite policies for mental health services and multiple imaging services. We refer readers to the CY 2008 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (72 FR 66611 through 66614 and 66650 through 66652) for a full discussion of the development of the composite APC methodology, and the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (76 FR 74163) and the CY 2018 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (82 FR 59241 through 59242 and 59246 through 52950) for more recent background.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="red">In the CY 2005 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (69 FR 65805), we implemented section 1833(t)(15) of the Act by instructing hospitals to bill for a drug or biological that is newly approved by the FDA and that does not yet have a HCPCS code by reporting the National Drug Code (NDC) for the product along with the newly created HCPCS code C9399 (Unclassified drugs or biologicals). We explained that when HCPCS code C9399 appears on a claim, the Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) suspends the claim for manual pricing by the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC). The MAC prices the claim at 95 percent of the drug or biological's AWP, using Red Book or an equivalent recognized compendium, and processes the claim for payment. We emphasized that this approach enables hospitals to bill and receive payment for a new drug or biological concurrent with its approval by the FDA. The hospital does not have to wait for the next quarterly release or for approval of a product-specific HCPCS code to receive payment for a newly approved drug or biological or to resubmit claims for adjustment. We instructed that hospitals would discontinue billing HCPCS code C9399 and the NDC upon implementation of a product specific HCPCS code, status indicator, and appropriate payment amount with the next quarterly update. We also note that HCPCS code C9399 is paid in a similar manner in the ASC setting, as 42 CFR 416.171(b) outlines that certain drugs and biologicals for which separate payment is allowed under the OPPS are considered covered ancillary services for which the OPPS payment rate, which is 95 percent of AWP for HCPCS code C9399, applies. Since the implementation of the C-APC policy in 2015, payment for drugs and biologicals described by HCPCS code C9399 has been included in the C-APC payment when these products appear on a claim with a primary C-APC service. Packaging payment for these drugs and biologicals that appear on a hospital outpatient claim with a primary C-APC service is consistent with our C-APC packaging policy under which we make payment for all items and services, including all non-pass-through drugs, reported on the hospital outpatient claim as being integral, ancillary, supportive, dependent, and adjunctive to the primary service and representing components of a complete comprehensive service, with certain limited exceptions (78 FR 74869).

In addition, we set the payment rate for composite APC 8010 for CY 2018 at the same payment rate that will be paid for APC 5863, which is the maximum partial hospitalization per diem payment rate for a hospital, and finalized a policy that the hospital will continue to be paid the payment rate for composite APC 8010.

We continue to believe that the costs associated with administering a partial hospitalization program at a hospital represent the most resource intensive of all outpatient mental health services. Therefore, we do not believe that we should pay more for mental health services under the OPPS than the highest partial hospitalization per diem payment rate for hospitals.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="red">As discussed in the CY 2008 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (72 FR 66613), we believe it is important that the OPPS enhance incentives for hospitals to provide necessary, high quality care as efficiently as possible. For CY 2008, we developed composite APCs to provide a single payment for groups of services that are typically performed together during a single clinical encounter and that result in the provision of a complete service. Combining payment for multiple, independent services into a single OPPS payment in this way enables hospitals to manage their resources with maximum flexibility by monitoring and adjusting the volume and efficiency of services themselves. An additional advantage to the composite APC model is that we can use data from correctly coded multiple procedure claims to calculate payment rates for the specified combinations of services, rather than relying upon single procedure claims which may be low in volume and/or incorrectly coded. Under the OPPS, we currently have composite policies for mental health services and multiple imaging services. We refer readers to the CY 2008 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (72 FR 66611 through 66614 and 66650 through 66652) for a full discussion of the development of the composite APC methodology, and the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (76 FR 74163) and the CY 2018 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (82 FR 59241 through 59242 and 59246 through 52950) for more recent background.</td><td></td></tr>

<tr><td class="red">Packaging also encourages hospitals to effectively negotiate with manufacturers and suppliers to reduce the purchase price of items and services or to explore alternative group purchasing arrangements, thereby encouraging the most economical health care delivery. Similarly, packaging encourages hospitals to establish protocols that ensure that necessary services are furnished, while scrutinizing the services ordered by practitioners to maximize the efficient use of hospital resources. Packaging payments into larger payment bundles promotes the predictability and accuracy of payment for services over time. Finally, packaging may reduce the importance of refining service-specific payment because packaged payments include costs associated with higher cost cases requiring many ancillary items and services and lower cost cases requiring fewer ancillary items and services. Because packaging encourages efficiency and is an essential component of a prospective payment system, packaging payments for items and services that are typically integral, ancillary, supportive, dependent, or adjunctive to a primary service has been a fundamental part of the OPPS since its implementation in August 2000. As we continue to develop larger payment groups that more broadly reflect services provided in an encounter or episode of care, we have expanded the OPPS packaging policies. Most, but not necessarily all, categories of items and services currently packaged in the OPPS are listed in 42 CFR 419.2(b). Our overarching goal is to make payments for all services under the OPPS more consistent with those of a prospective payment system and less like those of a per-service fee schedule, which pays separately for each coded item. As a part of this effort, we have continued to examine the payment for items and services provided under the OPPS to determine which OPPS services can be packaged to further achieve the objective of advancing the OPPS toward a more prospective payment system.</td><td></td></tr>

Many commenters raised concerns about sharply rising labor costs, especially the cost of nursing care. Commenters stated that during the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals greatly increased their use of contract nurses whose wages and support costs were substantially higher than nurses regularly employed by hospitals. Commenters had serious concerns about whether the market basket data that measures labor costs were measuring the increased hospital labor costs. Commenters also were in favor of eliminating or substantially reducing the productivity adjustment from the OPD rate update.

<tr><td class="red">The Affordable Care Act contained several provisions affecting the wage index. These provisions were discussed in the CY 2012 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (76 FR 74191). Section 10324 of the Affordable Care Act added section 1886(d)(3)(E)(iii)(II) to the Act, which defines a frontier State and amended section 1833(t) of the Act to add paragraph (19), which requires a frontier State wage index floor of 1.00 in certain cases, and states that the frontier State floor shall not be applied in a budget neutral manner. We codified these requirements at § 419.43(c)(2) and (3) of our regulations. For 2023, we propose to implement this provision in the same manner as we have since CY 2011. Under this policy, the frontier State hospitals would receive a wage index of 1.00 if the otherwise applicable wage index (including reclassification, the rural floor, and rural floor budget neutrality) is less than 1.00. Because the HOPD receives a wage index based on the geographic location of the specific inpatient hospital with which it is associated, the frontier State wage index adjustment applicable for the inpatient hospital also would apply for any associated HOPD. We refer readers to the FY 2011 through FY 2022 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rules for discussions regarding this provision, including our methodology for identifying which areas meet the definition of “frontier States” as provided for in section 1886(d)(3)(E)(iii)(II) of the Act: for FY 2011, 75 FR 50160 through 50161; for FY 2012, 76 FR 51793, 51795, and 51825; for FY 2013, 77 FR 53369 through 53370; for FY 2014, 78 FR 50590 through 50591; for FY 2015, 79 FR 49971; for FY 2016, 80 FR 49498; for FY 2017, 81 FR 56922; for FY 2018, 82 FR 38142; for FY 2019, 83 FR 41380; for FY 2020, 84 FR 42312; for FY 2021, 85 FR 58765; and for FY 2022, 86 FR 45178.</td><td></td></tr>

<tr><td class="red">In addition to the changes required by the Affordable Care Act, we note that the proposed FY 2023 IPPS wage indexes continue to reflect a number of adjustments implemented in past years, including, but not limited to, reclassification of hospitals to different geographic areas, the rural floor provisions, the imputed floor wage index adjustment in all-urban states, an adjustment for occupational mix, an adjustment to the wage index based on commuting patterns of employees (the out-migration adjustment), and an adjustment to the wage index for certain low wage index hospitals to help address wage index disparities between low and high wage index hospitals. We refer readers to the FY 2023 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (87 FR 28357 through 28380) for a detailed discussion of all proposed changes to the FY 2023 IPPS wage indexes. We note in particular that in the FY 2023 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (87 FR 28377 through 28380), we proposed a permanent approach to smooth year-to-year decreases in hospitals' wage indexes. Specifically, for FY 2023 and subsequent years, we proposed to apply a 5-percent cap on any decrease to a hospital's wage index from its wage index in the prior FY, regardless of the circumstances causing the decline. That is, we proposed that a hospital's wage index for FY 2023 would not be less than 95 percent of its final wage index for FY 2022, and that for subsequent years, a hospital's wage index would not be less than 95 percent of its final wage index for the prior FY. We stated that we believe this policy would increase the predictability of IPPS payments for hospitals and mitigate instability and significant negative impacts to hospitals resulting from changes to the wage index. It would also eliminate the need for temporary and potentially uncertain transition adjustments to the wage index in the future due to specific policy changes or circumstances outside hospitals' control.</td><td></td></tr>

The commenter believes that section 1886(d)(5)(I)(i) of the Act, which states that “(t)he Secretary shall provide by regulation for such other exceptions and adjustments to such payment amounts under this subsection as the Secretary deems appropriate . . . ,” gives CMS flexibility to identify adjustments that could update the IPPS market basket to better reflect rapidly increasing input costs for hospitals.</td></tr>

Applying this adjustment is consistent with our policy of adopting IPPS wage index policies for hospitals paid under the OPPS.

<tr><td></td><td class="green">The Affordable Care Act contained several provisions affecting the wage index.

Section 10324 of the Affordable Care Act added section 1886(d)(3)(E)(iii)(II) to the Act, which defines a frontier State and amended section 1833(t) of the Act to add paragraph (19), which requires a frontier State wage index floor of 1.00 in certain cases, and states that the frontier State floor shall not be applied in a budget neutral manner. We codified these requirements at § 419.43(c)(2) and (3) of our regulations. In the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we proposed to implement this provision in the same manner as we have since CY 2011. Under this policy, the frontier State hospitals would receive a wage index of 1.00 if the otherwise applicable wage index (including reclassification, the rural floor, and rural floor budget neutrality) is less than 1.00. Because the HOPD receives a wage index based on the geographic location of the specific inpatient hospital with which it is associated, the frontier State wage index adjustment applicable for the inpatient hospital also would apply for any associated HOPD. We referred readers to the FY 2011 through FY 2022 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rules for discussions regarding this provision, including our methodology for identifying which areas meet the definition of “frontier States” as provided for in section 1886(d)(3)(E)(iii)(II) of the Act: for FY 2011, 75 FR 50160 through 50161; for FY 2012, 76 FR 51793, 51795, and 51825; for FY 2013, 77 FR 53369 through 53370; for FY 2014, 78 FR 50590 through 50591; for FY 2015, 79 FR 49971; for FY 2016, 80 FR 49498; for FY 2017, 81 FR 56922; for FY 2018, 82 FR 38142; for FY 2019, 83 FR 41380; for FY 2020, 84 FR 42312; for FY 2021, 85 FR 58765; and for FY 2022, 86 FR 45178.</td></tr>

Also, similar to other clinical APCs that have been converted to C-APCs, there are higher APC levels (Levels 3-8 Urology and Related Services) within the clinical family or related clinical family of this APC that have previously been converted to C-APCs.</td><td></td></tr>

<tr><td class="red">The OPPS provides outlier payments to hospitals to help mitigate the financial risk associated with high-cost and complex procedures, where a very costly service could present a hospital with significant financial loss. As explained in the CY 2015 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (79 FR 66832 through 66834), we set our projected target for aggregate outlier payments at 1.0 percent of the estimated aggregate total payments under the OPPS for the prospective year. Outlier payments are provided on a service-by-service basis when the cost of a service exceeds the APC payment amount multiplier threshold (the APC payment amount multiplied by a certain amount) as well as the APC payment amount plus a fixed-dollar amount threshold (the APC payment plus a certain dollar amount). In CY 2022, the outlier threshold was met when the hospital's cost of furnishing a service exceeded 1.75 times (the multiplier threshold) the APC payment amount and exceeded the APC payment amount plus $6,175 (the fixed-dollar amount threshold) (86 FR 63508 through 63510). If the hospital's cost of furnishing a service exceeds both the multiplier threshold and the fixed-dollar threshold, the outlier payment is calculated as 50 percent of the amount by which the hospital's cost of furnishing the service exceeds 1.75 times the APC payment amount. Beginning with CY 2009 payments, outlier payments are subject to a reconciliation process similar to the IPPS outlier reconciliation process for cost reports, as discussed in the CY 2009 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (73 FR 68594 through 68599).</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="green">As we noted, in the FY 2023 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (87 FR 49018 through 49021), for FY 2023 and subsequent years, we finalized an IPPS wage index policy to apply a 5-percent cap on any decrease to a hospital's wage index from its wage index in the prior fiscal year, regardless of the circumstances causing the decline. A hospital's wage index for FY 2023 will not be less than 95 percent of its final wage index for FY 2022, and for subsequent years, a hospital's wage index will not be less than 95 percent of its final wage index for the prior fiscal year. Except for newly opened hospitals, we will apply the cap for a fiscal year using the final wage index applicable to the hospital on the last day of the prior fiscal year. A newly opened hospital would be paid the wage index for the area in which it is geographically located for its first full or partial fiscal year, and it would not receive a cap for that first year because it would not have been assigned a wage index in the prior year. We stated in the FY 2023 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (87 FR 49021) that we will apply the cap in a budget neutral manner through a national adjustment to the standardized amount each fiscal year. Specifically, we will apply a budget neutrality adjustment to ensure that estimated aggregate payments under our wage index cap policy for hospitals that would have a decrease in their wage indexes for the upcoming fiscal year of more than 5 percent would equal what estimated aggregate payments would have been without the wage index cap policy. We will apply a similar budget neutrality adjustment in the OPPS for each calendar year. For the OPPS, section 1833(t)(2)(D) of the Act requires the Secretary to determine a wage adjustment factor to adjust the portion of payment and coinsurance attributable to labor related costs for relative differences in labor and labor-related costs across geographic regions in a budget neutral manner.</td></tr>

For modeling estimated outlier payments, since the April 2022 OPSF contains cost data primarily from CY 2021 and CY 2022 and is the basis for current CY 2022 OPPS outlier payments, we believe the April 2022 OPSF provides a more updated and accurate data source for determining the CCRs that will be applied to CY 2023 hospital outpatient claims.

Our analysis showed a difference in costs for rural SCHs. Therefore, for the CY 2006 OPPS, we finalized a payment adjustment for rural SCHs of 7.1 percent for all services and procedures paid under the OPPS, excluding separately payable drugs and biologicals, brachytherapy sources, items paid at charges reduced to costs, and devices paid under the pass-through payment policy, in accordance with section 1833(t)(13)(B) of the Act.</td></tr>

For CY 2023, as we did for CY 2022, we proposed to assign APC 5012 a relative payment weight of 1.00 and to divide the geometric mean cost of each APC by the geometric mean cost for APC 5012 to derive the unscaled relative payment weight for each APC.

Specifically, we adopted a policy to provide additional payments to the cancer hospitals so that each cancer hospital's final PCR for services provided in a given calendar year is equal to the weighted average PCR (which we refer to as the “target PCR”) for other hospitals paid under the OPPS. The target PCR is set in advance of the calendar year and is calculated using the most recently submitted or settled cost report data that are available at the time of final rulemaking for the calendar year. The amount of the payment adjustment is made on an aggregate basis at cost report settlement. We note that the changes made by section 1833(t)(18) of the Act do not affect the existing statutory provisions that provide for TOPs for cancer hospitals. The TOPs are assessed, as usual, after all payments, including the cancer hospital payment adjustment, have been made for a cost reporting period.

Therefore, we proposed to apply the same CCR adjustment factor that we proposed to apply for the FY 2023 IPPS outlier calculation to the CCRs used to simulate the proposed CY 2023 OPPS outlier payments to determine the fixed-dollar threshold. Specifically, for CY 2023, we proposed to apply an adjustment factor of 0.974495 to the CCRs that were in the April 2022 OPSF to trend them forward from CY 2022 to CY 2023. The methodology for calculating the proposed CCR adjustment factor, as well as the solicitation of comments on an alternative approach, is discussed in the FY 2023 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (87 FR 28668). We note that we proposed to use the April 2022 OPSF for purposes of estimating costs for the OPPS outlier threshold calculation whereas in Section X.D. of the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (87 FR 44680 through 44682) we discussed using June 2020 HCRIS data extract for modeling hospital outpatient costs in construction of our CY 2023 OPPS relative weights. For modeling estimated outlier payments, since the April 2022 OPSF contains cost data primarily from CY 2021 and CY 2022 and is the basis for current CY 2022 OPPS outlier payments, we stated that we believe the April 2022 OPSF provides a more updated and accurate data source for determining the CCRs that will be applied to CY 2023 hospital outpatient claims. Therefore, we explained that we believe the April 2022 OPSF is a more accurate data source for determining the fixed-dollar threshold to ensure that the estimated CY 2023 aggregate outlier payments would equal 1.0 percent of estimated aggregate total payments under the OPPS.</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td class="green">                         We appreciate the commenters' concerns regarding the large increase in CY 2023 OPPS fixed-dollar threshold from CY 2022. We have reviewed and analyzed our methodology as well as the most up to date CCRs available in the July 2022 OPSF for determining estimated outlier payments. We estimate that the increase in the fixed-dollar threshold from CY 2022 to CY 2023 is largely attributable to an increase in reported charges on hospital outpatient claims. Holding CCRs constant, an increase in reported charges otherwise increases the charges reduced to cost on hospital outpatient claims. An additional contributing factor is an increase in hospital CCRs in the July 2022 OPSF when compared to the July 2021 OPSF. The increase in hospital CCRs further increases the charges reduced to cost on hospital outpatient claims. We believe the combination of these two factors has increased hospital outpatient costs, thereby allowing more cases to qualify for OPPS outlier payments. To counterbalance these increases, as described in our final calculation below, our modeling estimates a large increase in the OPPS fixed-dollar threshold is required to maintain a 1.0 percent OPPS outlier spending target. As discussed further in section X.D of this final rule with comment period, we believe it is reasonable to assume that there would continue to be some effects of the COVID-19 PHE on the outpatient claims that we use for OPPS ratesetting, similar to the CY 2021 claims data. As a result, we did not exclude such COVID-19 cases for determining the CY 2023 fixed-dollar threshold.</td></tr>

However, as discussed in the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (86 FR 63510), we finalized our proposal to not use the most recent CCRs in the OPSF as they may be significantly impacted by the PHE. As we discussed in the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC proposed rule (87 FR 44533 through 44534), we believe the updated OPSF data for modeling the outlier fixed dollar threshold in the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC proposed rule provides a more accurate data source for estimating CY 2023 aggregate outlier payments. Similarly, we believe using updated OPSF data for this final rule with comment period provides the best source of CCRs for OPPS outlier calculations. For CY 2023, we are applying the overall ancillary CCRs from the July 2022 OPSF file after adjustment (using the CCR inflation adjustment factor 0.974495 to approximate CY 2023 CCRs) to charges on CY 2021 claims that were adjusted using a charge inflation factor of 1.13218 to approximate CY 2023 charges. These are the same CCR adjustment and charge inflation factors that were used to model IPPS outlier payments and to determine the final IPPS fixed-loss threshold for the FY 2023 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule (87 FR 49427). We simulated aggregated CY 2023 hospital outlier payments using these costs for several different fixed-dollar thresholds, holding the 1.75 multiple-threshold constant and assuming that outlier payments will continue to be made at 50 percent of the amount by which the cost of furnishing the service would exceed 1.75 times the APC payment amount, until the total outlier payment equaled 1.0 percent of aggregated estimated total CY 2023 OPPS payments. We estimated that a fixed-dollar threshold of $8,625 combined with the multiple-threshold of 1.75 times the APC payment rate, will allocate 1.0 percent of aggregated total OPPS payments to outlier payments. For example, in CY 2023, if 1.75 times the APC amount is $5,000 and the applicable costs on the claim totaled $10,000 (which also exceeds our CY 2023 fixed-dollar threshold of $8,625), the hospital would receive an outlier payment of $2,500 (($10,000−$5,000) * 0.50). However, if the applicable cost on the claim totaled $8,000, which does not exceed our CY 2023 fixed-dollar threshold, no outlier payment would be made.</td></tr>

The statute authorizes the Secretary to make exceptions to the 2 times rule in unusual cases, such as for low-volume items and services (but the Secretary may not make such an exception in the case of a drug or biological that has been designated as an orphan drug under section 526 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act). In determining the APCs with a 2 times rule violation, we consider only those HCPCS codes that are significant based on the number of claims. We note that, for purposes of identifying significant procedure codes for examination under the 2 times rule, we consider procedure codes that have more than 1,000 single major claims or procedure codes that both have more than 99 single major claims and contribute at least 2 percent of the single major claims used to establish the APC cost to be significant (75 FR 71832). This longstanding definition of when a procedure code is significant for purposes of the 2 times rule was selected because we believe that a subset of 1,000 or fewer claims is negligible within the set of approximately 100 million single procedure or single session claims we use for establishing costs. Similarly, a procedure code for which there are fewer than 99 single claims and that comprises less than 2 percent of the single major claims within an APC will have a negligible impact on the APC cost (75 FR 71832). In this section of this proposed rule, for CY 2023, we propose to make exceptions to this limit on the variation of costs within each APC group in unusual cases, such as for certain low-volume items and services.</td><td></td></tr>

Section 11101 of the Inflation Reduction Act requires a Part B inflation rebate for a Part B rebatable drug if the ASP of the drug rises at a rate that is faster than the rate of inflation. Section 11101(b) of the IRA amended sections 1833(i) and 1833(t)(8) by adding a new paragraph (9) and subparagraph (F), respectively, that specifies coinsurance under the ASC and OPPS payment systems. Section 1833(i)(9) requires that under the ASC payment system that beneficiary coinsurance for a Part B rebatable drug that is not packaged to be calculated using the inflation-adjusted amount when that amount is less than the otherwise applicable payment amount for the drug furnished on or after April 1, 2023. Section 1833(t)(8)(F) requires that under the OPPS payment system that beneficiary copayment for a Part B rebatable drug (except for a drug that has no copayment applied under subparagraph (E) of such section or packaged into the payment for a procedure) is to be calculated using the inflation-adjusted amount when that amount is less than ASP plus 6 percent beginning April 1, 2023. Sections 1833(i)(9) and 1833(t)(8)(F) reference sections 1847A(i)(5) for the computation of the beneficiary coinsurance and 1833(a)(1)(EE) for the computation of the payment to the ASC or provider and state that the computations would be done in the same manner as described in such provisions. The computation of the coinsurance is described in section 1847A(i), specifically, in computing the amount of any coinsurance applicable under Part B to an individual to whom such Part B rebatable drug is furnished, the computation of such coinsurance shall be equal to 20 percent of the inflation-adjusted payment amount determined under section 1847A(i)(3)(C) for such part B rebatable drug. The calculation of the payment to the provider or ASC is described in section 1833(a)(1)(EE), and the provider or ASC would be paid the difference between the beneficiary coinsurance or copayment of the inflation-adjusted amount and ASP plus 6 percent.

However, we also recognized that it is not prudent for the code that describes the administration of this unique gene therapy, C97X1, to be assigned to the same C-APC to which HCPCS code 67036 is assigned, as this would package the primary therapy, HCPCS code J3398, into the code that represents the process to administer the gene therapy.</td><td></td></tr>

<tr><td class="red">A randomized, double-blinded, controlled IDE study is currently in progress for the V-Wave interatrial shunt. The V-Wave interatrial shunt is for patients with severe symptomatic heart failure and is designed to regulate left atrial pressure in the heart. All participants who passed initial screening for the study receive a right heart catheterization procedure described by CPT code 93451 (Right heart catheterization including measurement(s) of oxygen saturation and cardiac output, when performed). Participants assigned to the experimental group also receive the V-Wave interatrial shunt procedure while participants assigned to the control group only receive right heart catheterization. The developer of V-Wave was concerned that the current coding of these services by Medicare would reveal to the study participants whether they had received the interatrial shunt because an additional procedure code, CPT code 93799 (Unlisted cardiovascular service or procedure), would be included on the claims for participants receiving the interatrial shunt. Therefore, for CY 2020, we created a temporary HCPCS code to describe the V-wave interatrial shunt procedure for both the experimental group and the control group in the study. Specifically, we established HCPCS code C9758 (Blinded procedure for NYHA class III/IV heart failure; transcatheter implantation of interatrial shunt or placebo control, including right heart catheterization, trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE)/intracardiac echocardiography (ICE), and all imaging with or without guidance (for example, ultrasound, fluoroscopy), performed in an approved investigational device exemption (IDE) study) to describe the service, and we assigned the service to New Technology APC 1589 (New Technology—Level 38 ($10,001-$15,000)).</td><td></td></tr>

<tr><td class="red">CY 2020 was the first year for which we had Medicare claims data to calculate the cost of HCPCS code 0503T. For the CY 2020 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, there were 957 claims with CPT code 0503T, of which 101 were single frequency claims that were used to calculate the geometric mean of the procedure. We planned to use the geometric mean to determine the cost of HeartFlow for purposes of determining the appropriate APC assignment for the procedure. However, the number of single claims for CPT code 0503T was below the New Technology APC low-volume payment policy threshold for the proposed rule, and this number of single claims was only two claims above the threshold for the New Technology APC low-volume policy for the final rule. Therefore, we used our equitable adjustment authority under section 1833(t)(2)(E) of the Act to calculate the geometric mean, arithmetic mean, and median using the CY 2018 claims data to determine an appropriate payment rate for HeartFlow using our New Technology APC low-volume payment policy. While the number of single frequency claims was just above our threshold to use the low-volume payment policy, we still had concerns about the normal cost distribution of the claims used to calculate the payment rate for HeartFlow, and we decided the low-volume payment policy would be the best approach to address those concerns.</td><td></td></tr>

<tr><td class="red">For CY 2023, we have three years of claims data from CY 2018, CY 2019, and CY 2021 for CPT code 0503T to review to determine whether there is an appropriate clinical APC to assign the HeartFlow service. First, we have sufficient single frequency claims from these three years to have a reliable estimate of the cost of the service. There were 101 single frequency claims in CY 2018, 465 single frequency claims in CY 2019, and 1,681 single frequency claims in CY 2021. The estimated cost of 0503T has been reasonably consistent over the same three years as well. The estimated cost of HeartFlow was around $768 in CY 2018, around $808 in CY 2019, and around $827 in CY 2021. Since the cost data have been stable for HeartFlow, we can assign it to a clinical APC using our regular process of using the most recent year of claims data for a procedure. HeartFlow is a diagnostic service, and the OPPS has a clinical APC series for diagnostic tests and related services, with the cost of 0503T based on claims data falling between Level 3, with a payment rate of around $498, and Level 4, with a payment rate of around $961. Since the geometric mean cost of HCPCS code 0503T is $827, and $827 is closer to $961 than $498, the best APC assignment for the HeartFlow procedure appears to be APC 5724 (Level 4 Diagnostic Tests and Related Services).</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="green">In the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period (86 FR 63743 through 63747), we finalized our proposal to designate clinical and brachytherapy APCs as low volume APCs if they have fewer than 100 single claims that can be used for ratesetting purposes in the claims year used for ratesetting for the prospective year. For the CY 2023 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, CY 2021 claims are generally the claims used for ratesetting; and clinical and brachytherapy APCs with fewer than 100 single claims from CY 2021 that can be used for ratesetting would be low volume APCs subject to our universal low volume APC policy. As we stated in the CY 2022 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we adopted this policy to reduce the volatility in the payment rate for those APCs with fewer than 100 single claims. Where a clinical or brachytherapy APC has fewer than 100 single claims that can be used for ratesetting, under our low volume APC payment adjustment policy we determine the APC cost as the greatest of the geometric mean cost, arithmetic mean cost, or median cost based on up to four years of claims data. We excluded APC 5853 (Partial Hospitalization for CMHCs) and APC 5863 (Partial Hospitalization for Hospital-based PHPs) from our universal low volume APC policy given the different nature of policies that affect the partial hospitalization program. We also excluded APC 2698 (Brachytx, stranded, nos) and APC 2699 (Brachytx, non-stranded, nos) as our current methodology for determining payment rates for non-specified brachytherapy sources is appropriate.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="red">In reviewing the claims data available for the CY 2021 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we believed that it was appropriate to create an additional Neurostimulator and Related Procedures level, between what were then the Levels 2 and 3 APCs. Creating this APC allowed for a smoother distribution of the costs between the different levels based on their resource costs and clinical characteristics. Therefore, for the CY 2021 OPPS, we finalized a five-level APC structure for the Neurostimulator and Related Procedures series (85 FR 85968 through 85970). In addition to creating the new level, we also assigned CPT code 0398T (Magnetic resonance image guided high intensity focused ultrasound (mrgfus), stereotactic ablation lesion, intracranial for movement disorder including stereotactic navigation and frame placement when performed) to the new Level 3 APC (85 FR 85970).</td><td></td></tr>

<tr><td class="red">Some commenters have requested that we create a Level 6 Neurostimulator and Related Procedures APC, due to their concerns around clinical and resource cost similarity in the Level 5 Neurostimulator and Related Procedures APC. Based on our review of the data available for this CY 2023 OPPS/ASC proposed rule, we believe that the five-level structure for the Neurostimulator and Related Procedures APC series remains appropriate. The proposed geometric mean cost for the Level 5 Neurostimulator and Related Procedures is $30,198.36 with the geometric means of cost significant codes in Level 5 ranging from approximately $28,000 to $36,000, which is well within the range of the 2 times rule. In addition, a review of the clinical characteristics of the services in the APC suggests that the current structure is appropriate. Finally, as discussed in the CY 2021 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period, we reiterate that the OPPS is a prospective payment system. We group procedures with similar clinical characteristics and resource costs into APCs and establish a payment rate that reflects the geometric mean of all services in the group even though the cost of each service within the APC may be higher or lower than the APC's geometric mean. As a result, in the OPPS any individual procedure may potentially be overpaid or underpaid because the payment rate is based on the geometric mean of the entire group of services in the APC. However, the impact of these payment differences should be mitigated when distributed across a large number of APCs. (85 FR 85968).</td><td></td></tr>

The reassignment of CPT code 0616T to APC 5495 increases the CY 2023 APC cost metric from the proposed $16,711.80 to $18,602.90 and increases the OPPS payment rate from $16,564.54 to $18,089.98.</td></tr>

Despite not meeting our threshold for fewer than 100 claims, we are finalizing our proposal to designate APC 5881 as a Low Volume APC since stakeholders would not have had an opportunity to comment on the significant change in payment for this APC if we were to not apply our Low Volume APC methodology.

They also noted that the geometric mean cost for the predecessor codes exceed the proposed payment rate of $3,235, and assignment of the new codes to APC 5341 would result in significant underpayment for the procedures. Based on the geometric mean cost for the predecessor codes, several of the commenters recommended reassignment of the new codes to the Level 1 and Level 2 laparoscopy APCs, specifically, APCs 5361 and 5362, and noted that many of the new codes are laparoscopic in nature. A few commenters identified the specific codes that should be crosswalked to APCs 5361 and 5362. Other commenters recommended establishing a new APC by grouping the new codes based on the length of the hernia or by length of the hernia, recurrence, and whether the hernia is incarcerated or strangulated. Some commenters suggested reassigning the eight codes to the Level 1 Laparoscopy APC, specifically, APC 5361, while another recommended assignment to New Technology APC 1566 (New Technology—Level 29 ($5501-$6000); proposed payment of $5,750.50). Some commenters favored establishing a new APC for the eight separately payable codes and suggested establishing the cost for the new APC based on the cost data from the predecessor codes.

<tr><td class="red">For CY 2022, CPT code 41899 (Unlisted procedure, dentoalveolar structures) is assigned to APC 5161 (Level 1 ENT Procedures). Unlisted codes, like CPT 41899, do not describe any specific procedure or service, so they lack the specificity needed to describe the resources used. As a reminder, the fact that a drug, device, procedure, or service is assigned a HCPCS code and a payment rate under the OPPS does not imply coverage by the Medicare program, but indicates only how the product, procedure, or service may be paid if covered by the program. Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) determine whether a drug, device, procedure, or other service meets all program requirements for coverage. For example, MACs determine that the drug, device, procedure, or service is reasonable and necessary to treat the beneficiary's condition and whether it is excluded from payment. Unlisted codes provide a way for providers to report services for which there is no HCPCS code that specifically describes the service furnished. Because of the lack of specificity, unlisted codes are generally assigned to the lowest level APC within the most appropriate clinically related APC group under the OPPS. However, we believe that APC 5161 (Level 1 ENT Procedures) is not the most clinically appropriate APC series for this code. While APC 5161 includes some dental services, we believe that CPT code 41899 is more closely aligned clinically to the dental services in APC 5871 (Dental Procedures), which is the sole APC where dental procedures described by the Current Dental Terminology (CDT) reside. Therefore, for CY 2023, we propose to reassign HCPCS code 41899 to clinical APC 5871, which is the only, and therefore lowest, APC group that specifically describes dental procedures.</td><td></td></tr>

Of the 15 new codes, 12 codes describe the repair of anterior abdominal hernias, specifically, epigastric, incisional, ventral, umbilical, and spigelian hernias that are performed via an open, laparoscopic, and robotic approach. Based on our review of the new codes, we noted that the eight new codes proposed to APC 5341 have one consistent feature in their code descriptions, specifically, that they are described as either “reducible” or “incarcerated/strangulated.” This characteristic of “reducible” and “incarcerated/strangulated” is also present in the predecessor/deleted codes. The descriptions of “reducible” and “incarcerated/strangulated” appear in both the predecessor and new codes, and because we have claims data for the predecessor codes, we believe that establishing the APCs based on this distinction provides us with more appropriate payments for the new codes.</td></tr>

Therefore, for the CY 2021 OPPS, we finalized a five-level APC structure for the Neurostimulator and Related Procedures series (85 FR 85968 through 85970).

We note that several of the new codes describe various approaches of the procedure, specifically, they are described as open, laparoscopic, and robotic. Because the new codes are not an exact replacement for the predecessor codes, we believe that we should acquire claims data for the rest of new codes before assigning all eight codes to APC 5361.

<tr><td class="red">Based on our review of CY 2021 claims data associated with the COVID-19 vaccine administration HCPCS codes, the geometric mean cost for APC 9397 is $25.86 and the geometric mean cost for APC 9398 is $36.80. We note that CY 2021 utilization of the COVID-19 vaccine administration codes in the outpatient hospital setting was very high, with nearly 7 million claims for these codes in that year and may not be reflective of future year utilization. Since we do not know if demand for COVID-19 vaccine administration in the outpatient hospital setting will be significantly different in CY 2023 than CY 2021 because CY 2021 was the first complete year for which we had COVID-19 vaccine administration claims data, and because we do not know if the PHE for COVID-19 will be in effect in CY 2023, we believe that we should maintain the $40 per dose payment rate for the COVID-19 administration HCPCS codes in CY 2023 until we have an additional year of claims data on which to base the payment rate. Therefore, for CY 2023 we propose to use the equitable adjustment authority at 1833(t)(2)(E) to maintain the payment rate of $40 for each of the COVID-19 vaccine administration APCs 9397 and 9398.

Some commenters did not make a specific suggestion as to the final APC assignment, but contended that the proposed payment was inadequate. Commenters most frequently recommended assignment to APC 5503 for CPT code 68841. Interested parties believed this would be a clinically appropriate APC assignment as, in their view, the insertion of Dextenza is an extraocular procedure; therefore, it would be appropriate to place CPT code 68841 into APC 5503, which is titled Level 3 Extraocular, Repair, and Plastic Eye Procedures, as this procedure is clinically similar to other extraocular procedures in that APC. Commenters believe this assignment is appropriate given the geometric mean cost for the predecessor CPT code 0356T was $2,227.06 in the proposed rule, which was similar to the proposed rule geometric mean cost of $2,159.58 for APC 5503. Commenters also believed that CMS should assign CPT code 68841 to the same APC as CPT codes 0699T and 66030 because all three procedures involve the delivery of medication to the eye. The commenters cited CPT code 66030 (Injection, anterior chamber of eye (separate procedure); medication) and CPT code 0699T (Injection, posterior chamber of eye; medication), which we proposed to assign to APC 5491 (Level 1 Intraocular Procedures) with a proposed payment rate of $2,201.12, as similar procedures to which CPT code 68841 should be compared. However, commenters recognized that CPT codes 0699T and 66030 were intraocular procedures, so it would not be appropriate to assign CPT code 68841 to the same APC. Since commenters recognized CPT code 68841 represented an extraocular procedure, they felt APC 5503 (Level 3 Extraocular, Repair, and Plastic Eye Procedures) would be an appropriate alternative APC assignment as this APC placement has a comparable payment rate to APC 5491. Some commenters stated that a “Q1” status indicator was inappropriate, but did not provide an alternative suggestion.

We find it appropriate to package HCPCS code J1096 based on its clinical use patterns. Consistent with our clinical review and commenters' input, we believe this drug is mostly performed during ophthalmic surgeries, such as cataract surgeries. The packaging of this drug is consistent with 42 CFR 419.2(b). Specifically, 42 CFR 419.2(b)(16) includes drugs and biologicals that function as supplies when used in a surgical procedure among the items and services for which payment is packaged under the OPPS. Historically, we have stated that we consider all items related to the surgical outcome and provided during the hospital stay in which the surgery is performed, including postsurgical pain management drugs, to be part of the surgery for purposes of our drug and biological surgical supply packaging policy (79 FR 66875). The packaging of this code supports our overarching goal to make payments for all services paid under the OPPS and ASC payment system more consistent with those of a prospective payment system and less like those of a per-service fee schedule. We believe that packaging encourages efficiency and is an essential component of a prospective payment system and that packaging payments for items and services that are typically integral, ancillary, supportive, dependent, or adjunctive to a primary service is a fundamental part of the OPPS.

The applicant stated that achieving the proper balance between these factors has been shown to directly contribute to improved clinical outcomes and increased patient satisfaction.
