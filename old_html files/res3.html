<h2>Supervision by Nonphysician Practitioners of Hospital and CAH Diagnostic Services Furnished to Outpatients</h2>
<div class="para changes">
<p>1. BackgroundThe regulation at 42 CFR 410.32 provides the conditions of Medicare Part B payment for diagnostic tests. Section 410.32(b) provides the supervision requirements for diagnostic x-ray tests, diagnostic laboratory tests, and other diagnostic tests paid under the PFS. Prior to 2020, the regulation allowed only physicians as defined under Medicare law to supervise the performance of these diagnostic tests.
                        In the interim final rule with comment period published on May 8, 2020, in the 
                        Federal Register
                         titled “Additional Policy and Regulatory Revisions in Response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency and Delay of Certain Reporting Requirements for the Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting Program” (the May 8th COVID-19 IFC) (85 FR 27550, 27555 through 27556, 27620), we revised § </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.32(b)(1) to allow, for the duration of the PHE, certain nonphysician practitioners (nurse practitioners, physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists and certified nurse midwifes) to supervise the performance of diagnostic tests to the extent they were authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law.
                    In the CY 2021 PFS final rule (85 FR 84590 through 84492, 85026), we further revised § </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.32(b)(1) to make the revisions made by the May 8th COVID-19 IFC permanent and to add certified registered nurse anesthetists to the list of nonphysician practitioners permitted to provide supervision of diagnostic tests to the extent authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law.As we explained in those final rules, the basis for making these revisions was to both ensure that an adequate number of health care professionals were available to support critical COVID-19-related and other diagnostic testing needs and provide needed medical care during the PHE and to implement policy consistent with section 5(a) of the President's Executive Order 13890 on “Protecting and Improving Medicare for Our Nation's Seniors” (84 FR 53573, October 8, 2019, E.O. 13890), which directed the Secretary to identify and modify Medicare regulations that contained more restrictive supervision requirements than existing scope of practice laws, or that limited healthcare professionals from practicing at the top of their license. We refer readers to the May 8th COVID-19 IFC (85 FR 27555 through 27556, 27620) and CY 2021 PFS final rule (85 FR 84590 through 84492, 85026) for a more detailed discussion of the reasoning behind our revisions to § </p>

<p class="red">”</p><p> Section 410.32(b)(2) provides a list of services that are excepted from the basic rule in § </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.32(b)(1). Section 410.32(b)(3) defines the levels of supervision referenced in § </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.32(b)(1): general supervision (§ </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.32(b)(3)(i)); direct supervision (§ </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.32(b)(3)(ii)); and personal supervision (§ </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.32(b)(3)(iii)). Within these three definitions, only the definition for direct supervision indicates that a “supervising practitioner” other than a physician can provide the required supervision. The definitions for general and personal supervision continue to refer only to a physician providing the required level of supervision. Although the definitions of general and personal supervision do not specify that a “supervising practitioner” could furnish these levels of supervision, the above-described revisions to the “basic rule” governing supervision of diagnostic tests at § </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.32(b)(1) allow certain nonphysician practitioners to provide general and personal supervision to the extent they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law.</p>

<p class="green"> </p><p>410.28(e) for diagnostic tests in those settings. Section 410.28(e) relies upon the definitions of general, direct (for nonhospital locations) and personal supervision at § </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.32(b)(3)(i) through (iii) by cross-referencing those definitions. As noted above, the term “supervising practitioner” is absent from those definitions, although the “basic rule” at § </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.32(b)(1) allows certain nonphysician practitioners to provide general and personal supervision to the extent they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law. However, § </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.32(b) is explicitly limited to “all diagnostic x-ray and other diagnostic tests covered under section 1861(s)(3) of the Act and payable under the physician fee schedule,” and § </p>

<p class="green"> </p><p>410.32(b) can provide supervision of diagnostic testing services furnished to outpatients by hospitals or CAHs. Specifically, we propose</p>
<p class="green">d</p><p> to revise our existing supervision requirements at § </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.28(e) to clarify that nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, physician assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives may provide general, direct, and personal supervision of outpatient diagnostic services to the extent that they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law.</p>
<p class="red">
                    </p>
<p class="green">Another revision that we proposed to §  410.28(e) was to extend the end date of the flexibility allowing for the virtual supervision of outpatient diagnostic services through audio/video real-time communications technology (excluding audio-only) from the end of the PHE to the end of the calendar year in which the PHE ends. The purpose of this proposal was to ensure consistency between the hospital and CAH regulations at §§ 410.27 and 410.28 with the physicians' office regulations at § 410.32. Although the proposed rule contained the proposed revisions to the regulatory text of §  410.28(e), regrettably, the above explanation of the reason for the proposed revisions was inadvertently omitted from the preamble of the proposed rule.</p><p>We also propose</p>
<p class="green">d</p><p> to replace the cross-references at § </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.28(e) to the definitions of general, direct (for outpatient services provided at a nonhospital location), and personal supervision at § </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.32(b)(3)(i) through (iii) with the text of those definitions as newly designated paragraphs (</p>

<p class="green">and </p><p>(iii), and (</p>

<p class="green"> </p><p>410.28.</p>
<p class="red">
                        </p><p>Similarly, since § </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.27, which provides the supervision requirements for therapeutic outpatient hospital and CAH services, also relies on the definitions of general and personal supervision at § </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.32(b)(3)(i) and (iii), we propose</p>
<p class="green">d</p><p> to replace the cross-references at § </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.27(a)(1)(iv)(A) and (B) with the text of those definitions so that they are now contained within § </p>
<p class="green"> </p><p>410.27. Additionally, for clarity we propose</p>
<p class="green">d</p><p> to designate the existing definition of direct supervision and the proposed definition of personal supervision at § </p>

<p class="green">(1) and (2), respectively. Finally, since §  410.27(a)(1)(iv)(B) and (D) contain duplicate definitions for direct supervision, we proposed to remove §  410.27(a)(1)(iv)(D) in its entirety and add its language regarding pulmonary rehabilitation, cardiac rehabilitation, and intensive cardiac rehabilitation services and the virtual presence of a physician through audio/video real-time communications technology during the PHE to the newly designated §  410.27(a)</p><p>(1)</p>

Comment:
                         Two commenters supported the proposal but objected to the continued use of the term “nonphysician practitioner.” One commenter suggested that we replace “nonphysician practitioner” with each practitioner's professional title (
                        i.e.,
                         “nurse practitioner,” “physician assistant,” etc.) or, collectively, “advance practice providers” and update all related regulations, guidance and information collection instruments accordingly. The second commenter similarly suggested that we expressly list “physician assistant,” “nurse practitioner,” and other professionals in the place of “nonphysician practitioner” and accordingly revise all related guidance documents.</p><p>

We note that §§ 410.27(g) and 410.28(e) specifically list the professional titles that are included in the term “nonphysician practitioner” for the purpose of each regulation. It is therefore unnecessary and would be impractical to replace all instances of “nonphysician practitioner” throughout each regulation with a list of each practitioner's professional titles. With respect to replacing “nonphysician practitioner” with “ad</p><p>v</p>

Response:
                         We do not agree that allowing certain nonphysician practitioners to supervise diagnostic tests will undermine the expertise of physicians or the value of their work. As discussed above, nonphysician practitioners (NPPs) may only supervise diagnostic tests</p><p> to the </p>
<p class="green">exte</p><p>n</p>
<p class="green">t they are permitted to do so under th</p><p>e</p>
<p class="green">ir scope of practice and state la</p><p>w</p>
<p class="green"> and nothing prohibits physicians from continuing to supervise any and a</p><p>l</p>
<p class="green">l diagnostic tests. We appreciate the commenter's suggestion that CMS consult with interested parties and clinical staff capable of speaking to the impact of allowing certain nonph</p><p>y</p>
