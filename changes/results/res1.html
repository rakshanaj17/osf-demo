                          In the interim final rule with comment period titled “Policy and Regulatory Provisions in Response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency</p>

                      </p><p>2021 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period to provide that this flexibility continues until the later of the end of the calendar year in which the PHE as defined in § 400.200 ends or December 31, 2021 (85 FR 86113 and 86299). In the CY 2021 OPPS/ASC final rule with comment period we also clarified that this flexibility excluded the presence of the supervising practitioner via audio-only telecommunications technology (85 FR 86113).
                          In the CY 2022 PFS final rule, CMS added CPT codes 93797 (Physician or other qualified health care professional services for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation; without continuous ECG monitoring (per session)) and 93798 (Physician or other qualified health care professional services for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation; with continuous ECG monitoring (per session)) and HCPCS codes G0422 (Intensive cardiac rehabilitation; with or without continuous ecg monitoring with exercise, per session) and G0423 (Intensive cardiac rehabilitation; with or without continuous ecg monitoring; without exercise, per session) to the Medicare Telehealth Services List on a Category 3 basis (86 FR 65055). These services will not be able to be furnished as Medicare telehealth services to beneficiaries in their homes after the PHE ends because of the statutory restrictions at section 1834(m)(4)(C)(ii) of the Act on eligible originating sites. However, the inclusion of these codes on the Medicare Telehealth Services List will enable payment for these services when furnished in full using two-way, audio/video communications technology when the beneficiary is in a medical setting that can serve as a telehealth originating site and meet the geographic requirements specified in section 1834(m)(4)(C). These services will remain on the Medicare Telehealth Services List through the end of CY 2023.In order to effectuate a similar policy under the OPPS, where PR, CR</p>

                          Comment:
                          We received many comments describing the value of rehabilitation services furnished to beneficiaries in their homes. Commenters requested that CMS maintain both the Hospitals Without Walls flexibility to make beneficiaries' homes provider-based departments of the hospital, and the definition of direct supervision to include the presence of the supervising practitioner through two-way, audio/video communication technology. Commenters requested that these changes be made permanent or, at the very least, maintained through the end of CY 2023.

                          Response:
                          We thank commenters for the additional information. We do not have the flexibility to continue HWW beyond the conclusion of the PHE as it was accomplished through PHE-specific waivers that will expire when the PHE ends. This means that, following the expiration of the PHE, pulmonary, cardiac, and intensive cardiac rehabilitation services will no longer be able to be provided in a beneficiary's home. However, we note that the CPT codes describing cardiac, pulmonary, and intensive cardiac rehabilitation services were added to the Medicare telehealth services list in the CY 2022 PFS final rule. This will allow beneficiaries who live in rural areas to continue to receive these services through telehealth at medical facilities from 152 days after the conclusion of the PHE until the end of 2023 and beneficiaries in non-rural areas and at home to receive these services via telehealth for 151 days post-PHE. In the interest of maintaining a similar policy under the OPPS, we are finalizing extending the revised definition of direct supervision to include the presence of the supervising practitioner through two-way, audio/video when the beneficiary is physically located in the hospital until December 31, 2023.
