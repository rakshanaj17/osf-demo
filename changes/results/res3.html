<h2>Supervision by Nonphysician Practitioners of Hospital and CAH Diagnostic Services Furnished to Outpatients</h2>
<div class="para changes">
<p>1. BackgroundThe regulation at 42 CFR 410.32 provides the conditions of Medicare Part B payment for diagnostic tests. Section 410.32(b) provides the supervision requirements for diagnostic x-ray tests, diagnostic laboratory tests, and other diagnostic tests paid under the PFS. Prior to 2020, the regulation allowed only physicians as defined under Medicare law to supervise the performance of these diagnostic tests.
                        In the interim final rule with comment period published on May 8, 2020, in the 
                        Federal Register
                         titled “Additional Policy and Regulatory Revisions in Response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency and Delay of Certain Reporting Requirements for the Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting Program” (the May 8th COVID-19 IFC) (85 FR 27550, 27555 through 27556, 27620), we revised § </p>
<p class="red">410.32(b)(1) to allow, for the duration of the PHE, certain nonphysician practitioners (nurse practitioners, physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists and certified nurse midwifes) to supervise the performance of diagnostic tests to the extent they were authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law.
                    In the CY 2021 PFS final rule (85 FR 84590 through 84492, 85026), we further revised § 410.32(b)(1) to make the revisions made by the May 8th COVID-19 IFC permanent and to add certified registered nurse anesthetists to the list of nonphysician practitioners permitted to provide supervision of diagnostic tests to the extent authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law.As we explained in those final rules, the basis for making these revisions was to both ensure that an adequate number of health care professionals were available to support critical COVID-19-related and other diagnostic testing needs and provide needed medical care during the PHE and to implement policy consistent with section 5(a) of the President's Executive Order 13890 on “Protecting and Improving Medicare for Our Nation's Seniors” (84 FR 53573, October 8, 2019, E.O. 13890), which directed the Secretary to identify and modify Medicare regulations that contained more restrictive supervision requirements than existing scope of practice laws, or that limited healthcare professionals from practicing at the top of their license. We refer readers to the May 8th COVID-19 IFC (85 FR 27555 through 27556, 27620) and CY 2021 PFS final rule (85 FR 84590 through 84492, 85026) for a more detailed discussion of the reasoning behind our revisions to § 410.32.Section 410.32(b)(1), titled “Basic rule,” states that “. . .all diagnostic x-ray and other diagnostic tests covered under section 1861(s)(3) of the Act and payable under the physician fee schedule must be furnished under the appropriate level of supervision by a physician as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act or, to the extent that they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law, by a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, physician assistant, certified registered nurse anesthetist, or a certified nurse-midwife.” Section 410.32(b)(2) provides a list of services that are excepted from the basic rule in § 410.32(b)(1). Section 410.32(b)(3) defines the levels of supervision referenced in § 410.32(b)(1): general supervision (§ 410.32(b)(3)(i)); direct supervision (§ 410.32(b)(3)(ii)); and personal supervision (§ 410.32(b)(3)(iii)). Within these three definitions, only the definition for direct supervision indicates that a “supervising practitioner” other than a physician can provide the required supervision. The definitions for general and personal supervision continue to refer only to a physician providing the required level of supervision. Although the definitions of general and personal supervision do not specify that a “supervising practitioner” could furnish these levels of supervision, the above-described revisions to the “basic rule” governing supervision of diagnostic tests at § 410.32(b)(1) allow certain nonphysician practitioners to provide general and personal supervision to the extent they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law.Section 410.28 provides conditions of payment for diagnostic services under Medicare Part B provided to outpatients by, or under arrangements by, hospitals and CAHs, including specific supervision requirements under § 410.28(e) for diagnostic tests in those settings. Section 410.28(e) relies upon the definitions of general, direct (for nonhospital locations) and personal supervision at § 410.32(b)(3)(i) through (iii) by cross-referencing those definitions. As noted above, the term “supervising practitioner” is absent from those definitions, although the “basic rule” at § 410.32(b)(1) allows certain nonphysician practitioners to provide general and personal supervision to the extent they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law. However, § 410.32(b) is explicitly limited to “all diagnostic x-ray and other diagnostic tests covered under section 1861(s)(3) of the Act and payable under the physician fee schedule,” and § 410.28(e) does not contain any such “basic rule” to clarify that nonphysician practitioners can provide general and personal supervision.2. Proposed Revisions to 42 CFR 410.28 and § 410.27
                        For purposes of clarity and consistency, we propose to revise § 410.28(e) to clarify that the same nonphysician practitioners that can provide general and personal 
                        Start Printed Page 44683
                        supervision of diagnostic testing services payable under the PFS under § 410.32(b) can provide supervision of diagnostic testing services furnished to outpatients by hospitals or CAHs. Specifically, we propose to revise our existing supervision requirements at § 410.28(e) to clarify that nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, physician assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives may provide general, direct, and personal supervision of outpatient diagnostic services to the extent that they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law.
                    We also propose to replace the cross-references at § 410.28(e) to the definitions of general, direct (for outpatient services provided at a nonhospital location), and personal supervision at § 410.32(b)(3)(i) through (iii) with the text of those definitions as newly designated paragraphs (1), (2)(i), (2)(ii), (2)(iii), and (3) so that they are now contained within § 410.28.
                        Similarly, since § 410.27, which provides the supervision requirements for therapeutic outpatient hospital and CAH services, also relies on the definitions of general and personal supervision at § 410.32(b)(3)(i) and (iii), we propose to replace the cross-references at § 410.27(a)(1)(iv)(A) and (B) with the text of those definitions so that they are now contained within § 410.27. Additionally, for clarity we propose to designate the existing definition of direct supervision and the proposed definition of personal supervision at § 410.27(a)(1)(iv)(B) as § 410.27(a)(1)(iv)(B)
                        (1)
                         and 
                        (2),
                         respectively. Finally, since § 410.27(a)(1)(iv)(B) and (D) contain duplicate definitions for direct supervision, we propose to remove § 410.27(a)(1)(iv)(D) in its entirety and add its language regarding pulmonary rehabilitation, cardiac rehabilitation, and intensive cardiac rehabilitation services and the virtual presence of a physician through audio/video real-time communications technology during the PHE to the newly designated § 410.27(a)(1)(iv)(B)
                        (1).</p>
<p class="green"> 410.32(b)(1) to allow, for the duration of the PHE, certain nonphysician practitioners (nurse practitioners, physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists and certified nurse midwifes) to supervise the performance of diagnostic tests to the extent they were authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law.
                    In the CY 2021 PFS final rule (85 FR 84590 through 84492, 85026), we further revised §  410.32(b)(1) to make the revisions made by the May 8th COVID-19 IFC permanent and to add certified registered nurse anesthetists to the list of nonphysician practitioners permitted to provide supervision of diagnostic tests to the extent authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law.As we explained in those final rules, the basis for making these revisions was to both ensure that an adequate number of health care professionals were available to support critical COVID-19-related and other diagnostic testing needs and provide needed medical care during the PHE and to implement policy consistent with section 5(a) of the President's Executive Order 13890 on “Protecting and Improving Medicare for Our Nation's Seniors” (84 FR 53573, October 8, 2019, E.O. 13890), which directed the Secretary to identify and modify Medicare regulations that contained more restrictive supervision requirements than existing scope of practice laws, or that limited healthcare professionals from practicing at the top of their license.

                        Section 410.32(b)(1), titled “Basic rule,” provides that all diagnostic x-ray and other diagnostic tests covered under section 1861(s)(3) of the Act and payable under the physician fee schedule must be furnished under the 
                        Start Printed Page 72024
                        appropriate level of supervision by a physician as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act or, to the extent that they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law, by a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, physician assistant, certified registered nurse anesthetist, or a certified nurse-midwife. Section 410.32(b)(2) provides a list of services that are excepted from the basic rule in §  410.32(b)(1). Section 410.32(b)(3) defines the levels of supervision referenced in §  410.32(b)(1): general supervision (§  410.32(b)(3)(i)); direct supervision (§  410.32(b)(3)(ii)); and personal supervision (§  410.32(b)(3)(iii)). Within these three definitions, only the definition for direct supervision indicates that a “supervising practitioner” other than a physician can provide the required supervision. The definitions for general and personal supervision continue to refer only to a physician providing the required level of supervision. Although the definitions of general and personal supervision do not specify that a “supervising practitioner” could furnish these levels of supervision, the above-described revisions to the “basic rule” governing supervision of diagnostic tests at §  410.32(b)(1) allow certain nonphysician practitioners to provide general and personal supervision to the extent they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law.
                    Section 410.28 provides conditions of payment for diagnostic services under Medicare Part B provided to outpatients by, or under arrangements by, hospitals and CAHs, including specific supervision requirements under §  410.28(e) for diagnostic tests in those settings. Section 410.28(e) relies upon the definitions of general, direct (for nonhospital locations) and personal supervision at §  410.32(b)(3)(i) through (iii) by cross-referencing those definitions. As noted above, the term “supervising practitioner” is absent from those definitions, although the “basic rule” at §  410.32(b)(1) allows certain nonphysician practitioners to provide general and personal supervision to the extent they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law. However, §  410.32(b) is explicitly limited to “all diagnostic x-ray and other diagnostic tests covered under section 1861(s)(3) of the Act and payable under the physician fee schedule,” and §  410.28(e) does not contain any such “basic rule” to clarify that nonphysician practitioners can provide general and personal supervision.2. Proposed Revisions to 42 CFR 410.28 and 410.27
For purposes of clarity and consistency, we proposed to revise §  410.28(e) to clarify that the same nonphysician practitioners that can provide general and personal supervision of diagnostic testing services payable under the PFS under §  410.32(b) can provide supervision of diagnostic testing services furnished to outpatients by hospitals or CAHs. Specifically, we proposed to revise our existing supervision requirements at §  410.28(e) to clarify that nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, physician assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives may provide general, direct, and personal supervision of outpatient diagnostic services to the extent that they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law.Another revision that we proposed to §  410.28(e) was to extend the end date of the flexibility allowing for the virtual supervision of outpatient diagnostic services through audio/video real-time communications technology (excluding audio-only) from the end of the PHE to the end of the calendar year in which the PHE ends. The purpose of this proposal was to ensure consistency between the hospital and CAH regulations at §§ 410.27 and 410.28 with the physicians' office regulations at § 410.32. Although the proposed rule contained the proposed revisions to the regulatory text of §  410.28(e), regrettably, the above explanation of the reason for the proposed revisions was inadvertently omitted from the preamble of the proposed rule.We also proposed to replace the cross-references at §  410.28(e) to the definitions of general, direct (for outpatient services provided at a nonhospital location), and personal supervision at §  410.32(b)(3)(i) through (iii) with the text of those definitions as newly designated paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii), and (e)(3) so that they are now contained within §  410.28.Similarly, since §  410.27, which provides the supervision requirements for therapeutic outpatient hospital and CAH services, also relies on the definitions of general and personal supervision at §  410.32(b)(3)(i) and (iii), we proposed to replace the cross-references at §  410.27(a)(1)(iv)(A) and (B) with the text of those definitions so that they are now contained within §  410.27. Additionally, for clarity we proposed to designate the existing definition of direct supervision and the proposed definition of personal supervision at §  410.27(a)(1)(iv)(B) as §  410.27(a)(1)(iv)(B)(1) and (2), respectively. Finally, since §  410.27(a)(1)(iv)(B) and (D) contain duplicate definitions for direct supervision, we proposed to remove §  410.27(a)(1)(iv)(D) in its entirety and add its language regarding pulmonary rehabilitation, cardiac rehabilitation, and intensive cardiac rehabilitation services and the virtual presence of a physician through audio/video real-time communications technology during the PHE to the newly designated §  410.27(a)(1)(iv)(B)(1).We received the following comments in response to our proposal:
Comment:
                         The majority of commenters supported our proposal, citing clarity, consistency, increased patient access to care and allowing nonphysician practitioners to practice at the top of their licenses and clinical training.
                    
Response:
                         We thank commenters for their support for our proposal.
                    
Comment:
                         Two commenters supported the proposal but objected to the continued use of the term “nonphysician practitioner.” One commenter suggested that we replace “nonphysician practitioner” with each practitioner's professional title (
                        i.e.,
                         “nurse practitioner,” “physician assistant,” etc.) or, collectively, “advance practice providers” and update all related regulations, guidance and information collection instruments accordingly. The second commenter similarly suggested that we expressly list “physician assistant,” “nurse practitioner,” and other professionals in the place of “nonphysician practitioner” and accordingly revise all related guidance documents.
                    
Response:
                         We appreciate these comments and agree with the importance of employing the appropriate designations for these practitioners. We note that §§ 410.27(g) and 410.28(e) specifically list the professional titles that are included in the term “nonphysician practitioner” for the purpose of each regulation. It is therefore unnecessary and would be impractical to replace all instances of “nonphysician practitioner” throughout each regulation with a list of each practitioner's professional titles. With respect to replacing “nonphysician practitioner” with “advance practice providers,” we understand the importance of using the most relevant and up to date terminology to describe these practitioners. However, as acknowledged by the commenters, “nonphysician practitioner” is used in 
                        Start Printed Page 72025
                        multiple regulations, guidance and other documents and any change in terminology would need to be considered in light of ensuring consistency across these authorities. We will take this suggestion into consideration for future rulemaking.
                    
Comment:
                         One commenter supported the proposal and requested, for improved clarity and to eliminate inefficiencies or delays in care caused by a misinterpretation of supervision policy, that we revise the definitions for general and personal supervision at § 410.32(b)(2)(i) and (iii) to include the “or other supervising practitioner” language contained in the definition for direct supervision at § 410.32(b)(2)(iii). Another commenter suggested that we revise the definitions for general and personal supervision at § 410.32(b)(2)(i) and (iii) to specifically reference “physician assistant.”
                    
Response:
                         We appreciate the commenters' suggestions but disagree that adding “or other supervising practitioner” or individual professional titles to the definitions for general and personal supervision at § 410.32(b)(2)(i) and (iii) would improve clarity or eliminate inefficiencies or delays in care caused by a misinterpretation of supervision policy. As acknowledged by the commenter, the “basic rule” governing supervision of diagnostic tests at § 410.32(b)(1) provides the authority for nonphysician practitioners to provide all three levels of supervision for the purposes of diagnostic x-ray tests, diagnostic laboratory tests, and other diagnostic tests. Since regulations other than § 410.32 rely upon the supervision definitions at § 410.32(b)(2)(i) and (iii) and those regulations may or may not allow nonphysician practitioners to provide general or personal supervision, it would be inappropriate to add “or other supervising practitioner” to § 410.32(b)(2)(i) and (iii) and doing so would likely result in further misinterpretations of supervision policy.
                    
Comment:
                         Two commenters opposed the proposed change, arguing that nonphysician practitioner skill sets are not interchangeable with those of fully educated and trained physicians and that physicians' more extensive and rigorous educational and training requirements make them uniquely qualified to supervise diagnostic tests. The first commenter maintains that physicians must supervise diagnostic tests to ensure patient safety and the accuracy of test results due to the complexity of certain diagnostic tests and studies demonstrating that nonphysician practitioners order more diagnostic tests, including tests subjecting patients to harmful radiation, than physicians. This commenter also refers to a study that concluded that allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to function with independent patient panels under physician supervision in the primary care setting resulted in higher costs, higher utilization of services and lower quality of care as compared to panels of patients with a primary care physician. The second commenter references surveys indicating that patients prefer physicians to lead their health care team and that more patients trust a physician to deliver their medical care in an emergency as compared to a nurse, nurse practitioner or physician assistant. Finally, both commenters argue that expanding the scope of practice of nurse practitioners will not increase patient access to care because the actual practice locations of nurse practitioners reveal that they tend to work in the same large urban areas as physicians.
                    
Response:
                         We acknowledge that physician skill sets are not fully interchangeable with the skill sets of nonphysician practitioners and that the education and training requirements of physicians differ from nonphysician practitioners. However, we do not agree that the skill sets, education and training of physicians render them solely qualified to supervise diagnostic services. With respect to the commenter's concerns about nonphysician practitioners' abilities to safely and accurately perform diagnostic tests, we note that the proposed regulation explicitly limits nonphysician supervision to that which is permitted under the nonphysician practitioner's scope of practice and state law. Furthermore, nothing in the proposed regulation prohibits or limits physicians from continuing to supervise any and all diagnostic tests. Providers and physicians are free to use their own judgment to determine whether supervision by nonphysician practitioners is appropriate on a systemic, categorical or case-by-case basis.
                    As to the studies and surveys cited by commenters related to the functioning of nonphysician practitioners with independent patient panels in the primary care setting and patient preferences regarding who leads their care team and provides their emergency care, it is not clear what the relevancy of these are to allowing nonphysician practitioners to supervise diagnostic tests.Finally, we do not agree with commenters' claim that the practice locations of nurse practitioners demonstrate that patient access to care will not increase by allowing nonphysician practitioners to supervise diagnostic tests. We do not find the evidence submitted by the commenters sufficient to support the commenters' conclusion that most nurse practitioners tend to live in the same urban areas as physicians. Further, even if this evidence was sufficient, it only includes nurse practitioners; it fails to account for those rural areas in which nurse practitioners do reside, where it could be expected that allowing nonphysician practitioners to supervise diagnostic tests would increase patient access to care; and it fails to account for medically underserved urban areas where it could also be expected that allowing nonphysician practitioners to supervise diagnostic tests would increase patient access to care.
Comment:
                         One commenter supported making the terminology used for supervision definitions consistent but cautioned CMS against what the commenter characterized as “rolling back” supervision guidelines. This commenter argued that the continued proposals and regulatory changes allowing nonphysician practitioners to supervise services of various complexities undermines the expertise of physicians and the value of their work. The commenter also expressed concern that many providers conflate physician supervision with physician work, creating scenarios for abuse and inadequate support for clinical staff. Finally, the commenter requested that CMS consult with interested parties and clinical staff from various specialties capable of speaking to the impact these continued changes have had on services provided to beneficiaries.
                    
Response:
                         We do not agree that allowing certain nonphysician practitioners to supervise diagnostic tests will undermine the expertise of physicians or the value of their work. As discussed above, nonphysician practitioners (NPPs) may only supervise diagnostic tests to the extent they are permitted to do so under their scope of practice and state law and nothing prohibits physicians from continuing to supervise any and all diagnostic tests. We appreciate the commenter's suggestion that CMS consult with interested parties and clinical staff capable of speaking to the impact of allowing certain nonphysician practitioners to supervise diagnostic tests, and we will consider doing so in the future.
                    
                        After consideration of the public comments we received, we are finalizing, as proposed, our revisions to 
                        Start Printed Page 72026
                        replace cross-references at §§  410.27(a)(1)(iv)(A) and (B) and 410.28(e) to the definitions of general and personal supervision at §  410.32(b)(3)(i) and (iii) with the text of those definitions and to revise §  410.28(e) to (1) extend the end date of the flexibility allowing for the virtual supervision of outpatient diagnostic services through audio/video real-time communications technology (excluding audio-only) from the end of the PHE to the end of the calendar year in which the PHE ends, and (2) clarify that certain nonphysician practitioners (nurse practitioners, physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists and certified nurse midwifes) may supervise the performance of diagnostic tests to the extent they are authorized to do so under their scope of practice and applicable State law.
