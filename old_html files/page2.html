    <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
    <p>This final rule with comment period revises the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS)
        and the Medicare ambulatory surgical center (ASC) payment system for Calendar Year (CY) 2023 based on our
        continuing experience with these systems. We describe the changes to the amounts and factors used to determine
        the payment rates for Medicare services paid under the OPPS and those paid under the ASC payment system. Also,
        this final rule updates and refines the requirements for the Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR)
        Program; the ASC Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program; and the Rural Emergency Hospital Quality Reporting (REH)
        Program. We also make updates to the requirements for Organ Acquisition, REHs, Prior Authorization, and Overall
        Hospital Quality Star Rating. We are establishing a new provider type for REHs, and we are finalizing proposals
        regarding payment policy, quality measures, and enrollment policy for REHs. In addition, we are finalizing the
        Conditions of Participation that REHs must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
        This rule also finalizes changes to the Critical Access Hospitals (CAH) CoPs for the location and distance
        requirements, patient's rights requirements, and flexibilities for CAHs that are part of a larger health system.
        Finally, we are finalizing as implemented a number of provisions included in the COVID-19 interim final rules
        with comment period (IFCs).</p>

    <h2>I. Summary and Background</h2>

    <h3>A. Executive Summary of This Document</h3>

    <h4>1. Purpose</h4>

    <p>
        In this final rule with comment period, we are updating the payment policies and payment rates for services
        furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) and ambulatory surgical centers
        (ASCs), beginning January 1, 2023. Section 1833(t) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires us to annually
        review and update the payment rates for services payable under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment
        System (OPPS). Specifically, section 1833(t)(9)(A) of the Act requires the Secretary of the Department of Health
        and Human Services (the Secretary) to review certain components of the OPPS not less often than annually, and to
        revise the groups, the relative payment weights, and the wage and other adjustments that take into account
        changes in medical practice, changes in technology, and the addition of new services, new cost data, and other
        relevant information and factors. In addition, under section 1833(i)(D)(v) of the Act, we annually review and
        update the ASC payment rates. This final rule with comment period also includes additional policy changes made
        in accordance with our experience with the OPPS and the ASC payment system and recent changes in our statutory
        authority. We describe these and various other statutory authorities in the relevant sections of this final rule
        with comment period. In addition, this rule updates and refines the requirements for the Hospital Outpatient
        Quality Reporting (OQR) Program and the ASC Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program. We also make updates to the
        requirements for Organ Acquisition, Prior Authorization, and Overall Hospital Quality Star Rating. We are also
        proposing new regulatory requirements to codify payment policy, quality measures, and enrollment policy for
        REHs. In addition, we are finalizing the Conditions of Participation that REHs must meet in order to participate
        in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This rule also finalizes changes to the Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)
        CoPs for the location and distance requirements, patient's rights requirements, and flexibilities for CAHs that
        are part of a larger health system. We thank commenters for submitting comment on the use of CMS data to drive
        competition in healthcare marketplaces, and the request for information on an alternative methodology for
        counting organs. Finally, we are finalizing as implemented, a number of provisions included in the COVID-19
        interim final rules with comment period (IFCs).

    <h4>
        2. Summary of the Major Provisions
    </h4>

    <p>
        • OPPS Update: For 2023, we are increasing the payment rates under the OPPS by an Outpatient Department (OPD)
        fee schedule increase factor of 3.8 percent. This increase factor is based on the final hospital inpatient
        market basket percentage increase of 4.1 percent for inpatient services paid under the hospital inpatient
        prospective payment system (IPPS) reduced by a final productivity adjustment of 0.3 percentage point. Based on
        this update, we estimate that total payments to OPPS providers (including beneficiary cost-sharing and estimated
        changes in enrollment, utilization, and case-mix) for calendar year (CY) 2023 would be approximately $86.5
        billion, an increase of approximately $6.5 billion compared to estimated CY 2022 OPPS payments.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are continuing to implement the statutory 2.0 percentage point reduction in payments for hospitals that fail
        to meet the hospital outpatient quality reporting requirements by applying a reporting factor of 0.9807 to the
        OPPS payments and copayments for all applicable services.
    </p>

    <p>
        • Data used in CY 2023 OPPS/ASC Ratesetting: To set CY 2023 OPPS and ASC payment rates, we would normally use
        the most updated claims and cost report data available. The best available claims data is the most recent set of
        data which would be from 2 years prior to the calendar year that is the subject of rulemaking. However, cost
        report data usually lags the claims data by a year and we believe that the CY 2020 cost report data are not the
        best overall approximation of expected outpatient hospital service costs as the majority of the cost reports we
        would typically use for CY 2023 rate setting have cost reporting periods that overlap with parts of the CY 2020
        Public Health Emergency (PHE). In order to mitigate the impact of some of the temporary changes in hospitals
        cost report data from CY 2020, we are utilizing cost report data from the June 2020 extract from Healthcare Cost
        Report Information System (HCRIS), which includes cost report data from prior to the PHE. This is the same cost
        report extract we used to set OPPS rates for CY 2022. We believe using the CY 2021 claims data with cost reports
        data through CY 2019 (prior to the PHE) for CY 2023 OPPS ratesetting is the best approximation of expected costs
        for CY 2023 hospital outpatient service ratesetting purposes. As a result, we are utilizing the CY 2021 claims
        data with cost reporting periods prior to the PHE to set CY 2023 OPPS and ASC payment system rates.
